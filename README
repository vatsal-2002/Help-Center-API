<!-- I have created only Database(MYSQL) and Backend(Node.js,Express.js) -->


<!-- Card Management API -->

This is a simple Node.js and Express-based API for managing cards with titles, descriptions, and links. The API allows you to create new cards, retrieve all cards, filter cards by title, and get a card by its exact title.

<!-- Features -->

Get All Cards: Retrieve all cards stored in the database.
Filter Cards by Title: Retrieve cards that match a specific title or part of a title.
Get Card by Exact Title: Retrieve a card by providing its exact title.
Create a New Card: Add a new card with a title, description, and optional link.

<!-- Prerequisites -->

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v12.x or later)
MySQL

<!-- Setup Instructions -->

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

1. Clone the Repository
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/card-management-api.git
   cd card-management-api

2. Install Dependencies
   Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary Node.js dependencies:
   npm install

3. Set Up the MySQL Database
   1.Create a Database:

   Open your MySQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, command-line).
   Create a new database, e.g., card_db.
   CREATE DATABASE help_center_db;

   2.Create the Cards Table:
   Switch to the newly created database:

   USE help_center_db;
   CREATE TABLE cards (
   id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
   title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
   description TEXT,
   link VARCHAR(255)
   );

4. Configure the Database Connection

   const mysql = require('mysql');

   const connection = mysql.createConnection({
   host: 'localhost',
   user: 'your_username', // Replace with your MySQL username
   password: 'your_password', // Replace with your MySQL password
   database: 'card_db' // Replace with your database name
   });

   connection.connect((err) => {
   if (err) {
   console.error('Error connecting to the database:', err.stack);
   return;
   }
   console.log('Connected to the database.');
   });

   module.exports = connection;

5. Run the Project

   npm start

<!-- API Endpoints -->
